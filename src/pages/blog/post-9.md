## How to use JavaScript in CSS

Did you know that you can use JavaScript in CSS? Yes, you read that right. You can write dynamic and interactive styles using the power of JavaScript. In this post, I will show you how to do that using a library called **JSS**.

### What is JSS?

JSS is a library that allows you to write CSS using JavaScript. It has a syntax similar to regular CSS, but with some extra features and benefits. For example, you can use variables, functions, mixins, conditionals, loops, and more. You can also use JavaScript modules and tools to organize and optimize your code.

### How to use JSS?

To use JSS, you need to install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
# with npm
npm install jss
# or with yarn
yarn add jss
```

Then, you need to import it in your JavaScript file:

```javascript
import jss from "jss";
```

Next, you need to create a JSS object and define your styles as a JavaScript object:

```javascript
const styles = {
  button: {
    color: "white",
    background: "blue",
    padding: "10px",
    borderRadius: "5px",
    "&:hover": {
      background: "darkblue",
    },
  },
};
```

Notice how the syntax is similar to regular CSS, but with some differences. For example, you can use camelCase instead of kebab-case for property names. You can also use nested selectors using the `&` symbol. And you can use any valid JavaScript expression as a value.

To apply the styles to your elements, you need to use the `createStyleSheet` method and the `attach` method:

```javascript
const sheet = jss.createStyleSheet(styles);
sheet.attach();
```

This will generate a style tag in the head of your document with the corresponding CSS rules. For example:

```css
.button-0-0-1 {
  color: white;
  background: blue;
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
.button-0-0-1:hover {
  background: darkblue;
}
```

To link your elements with the generated classes, you need to use the `classes` property of the sheet object:

```javascript
const button = document.getElementById("button");
button.className = sheet.classes.button;
```

This will assign the class name `button-0-0-1` to the button element.

### Why use JSS?

You might be wondering why would you want to use JavaScript in CSS. Well, there are some advantages of using JSS over regular CSS. For example:

- You can reuse and share code using variables, functions, mixins, etc.
- You can write dynamic and responsive styles using JavaScript logic and events.
- You can leverage the power of JavaScript modules and tools to organize and optimize your code.
- You can avoid some of the limitations and pitfalls of CSS such as specificity, inheritance, cascade, etc.
